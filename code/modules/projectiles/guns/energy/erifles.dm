//My attempt into things
//first block of code taken and modified from twohanded.dm
//HOPEFULLY it provides a result worth.. Keeping.
//Intent: make it so that rifles (ion rifle, laser rifle, whatever) need to be grasped with two hands to be effective
//Method: this below: if wielded, a rifle will have a normal fire_delay; if unwielded, it'll have doubled fire_delay
//
//NOTE: Due to how the parenting is set up, a /rifle/ parent is required for both projectile and energy weapons, seperately. I think. Easiest way of doing this <.<
//Also, may encounter problems with weapons that already have procs in place.
//
//If this works... All I can say is: I expected this to be tonnes harder.
//
//TO DO: Fix the onmob things
//
//CONTAINS:
//Laser Rifle
//Practice Laser
//Ion Rifle
//Sniper Rifle
//Laser Cannon
//Pulse Rifle
//Pulse Destroyed -- you use this, and I'll kill you
